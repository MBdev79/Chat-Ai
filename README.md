# Chat-Ai
This project is a simple yet fully functional AI chat application, developed as part of my ongoing learning journey in software development. It allows users to interact with an AI assistant in a smooth, intuitive, and user-friendly interface, making the experience of conversing with AI both engaging and accessible. Through building this application, I was able to deepen my understanding of core development principles, including front-end and back-end integration, state management, and user interface design.

In addition, the app features a built-in light and dark mode, enabling users to switch between themes according to their preference or ambient lighting conditions. This not only enhances usability and accessibility but also allowed me to gain practical experience in implementing dynamic theming and responsive design patterns. Overall, the project has been an invaluable opportunity to combine theoretical knowledge with hands-on experience in developing AI-based applications and crafting polished, user-centered interfaces.
